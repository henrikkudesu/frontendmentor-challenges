## My process
I structured the html in a semantic way, then finished styling the elements.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile first


### What I learned
I improved my CSS skills by building the mobile-first layout, which caused me less of a headache than usual. And it was surprisingly easy. Thanks to Kevin Powell!

### Continued development
Need to add the share menu with javascript. Gonna do it soon as possible.
