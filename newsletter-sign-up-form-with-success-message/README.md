## My process
Since I haven't coding in html and css for a long time, consider that the code is messed up, maybe some classes out of order in the css and a very poor structure. The project was just for training and remembering concepts. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
