## My process

First, I structured the HTML to be as semantic as possible. Then, I added custom properties (CSS variables) and started code CSS piece by piece. After I completed the desktop version, I added media queries and made changes to the units of measurement to make them responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Custom CSS Properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Google Fonts

### Continued development

I will continue studying the front-end to come back here in the future and make changes to the code to modernize it and make it more correct.
