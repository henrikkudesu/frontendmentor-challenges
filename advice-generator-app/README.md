## My process
As it's a small project, I didn't find it a problem to start with the desktop version. I styled everything as the challenge asks and then the easy part was making the API. There's not much to say about the process.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### ~~What I learned~~ What i need to learn
Mobile first, urgent. I also need to have a better sense of how to adjust the size of elements. I have the impression that I use percentage very wrongly to adjust the size of divs.

### Continued development
There's no mutch to change in this project, since its working perfectly without any bugs or errors.

### Useful resources
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - It helps me a lot. I don't need to waste time searching on Google or making a post on StackOverflow for possible solution for my problems. It is a great ally for studying.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - W3Schools is a website optimized for learning, testing, and training. Examples might be simplified to improve reading and basic understanding.
